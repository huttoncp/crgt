\title{Read a raw MedPC file from the ITI-9 version of the rat gambling task.}
\usage{
iti9_read_file(path = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string for the raw MedPC file path, e.g.
"!2021-11-13_7h01m.Subject 1" if the file is in your working directory. A
file explorer window will pop-up to allow you to choose the file
interactively if the path is unspecified.}

\description{
Read a raw MedPC (Tatham & Zurn, 1989) data file from the cued (Barrus &
Winstanley, 2016) or uncued (Zeeb et al., 2009) versions of the rat gambling
task (RGT) with a 9-second intertrial interval (ITI) and convert it into an R
data.table.
